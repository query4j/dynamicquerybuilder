## Security Best Practices for Users

### Dependency Management

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Monitor Advisories**: Watch for security announcements
- **Review Dependencies**: Check transitive dependencies
- **Automate Updates**: Use dependency management tools

### Configuration Security

- **Validate Input**: Always validate user input before queries
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use built-in parameter handling (never string concatenation)
- **Least Privilege**: Database users should have minimal permissions
- **Connection Security**: Use encrypted connections to databases
- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode credentials

### Example - Secure Usage

```java
// ‚úÖ SECURE: Using parameterized queries
QueryBuilder<User> query = QueryBuilder.forEntity(User.class)
    .where("email", userInput);  // Automatically parameterized

// ‚ùå INSECURE: Don't do this
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + userInput + "'";
```

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

Query4j includes several security features:

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - All queries use parameterized statements
   - No string concatenation of user input
   - Automatic parameter escaping

2. **Input Validation**
   - Field names validated against patterns
   - Operators validated against allowed list
   - Value types checked for compatibility

3. **Thread Safety**
   - Immutable design prevents race conditions
   - No shared mutable state
   - Safe for concurrent usage

4. **No Dynamic Code Execution**
   - No reflection-based vulnerabilities
   - No code generation at runtime
   - Compile-time type safety

## Known Security Considerations

### User Responsibilities

Users must ensure:

1. **Database Security**
   - Proper database user permissions
   - Network security for database connections
   - Regular database security updates

2. **Application Security**
   - Input validation at application boundaries
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Secure storage of credentials

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Secure configuration management
   - Regular security patches
   - Security monitoring and logging

---

## Security Audits

## Security-Related Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```java
// Production security configuration
Query4jConfig config = Query4jConfig.builder()
    .core(CoreConfig.builder()
        .maxPredicateDepth(5)      // Limit query complexity
        .maxPredicateCount(50)      // Limit predicate count
        .defaultQueryTimeoutMs(30000) // Prevent long-running queries
        .queryStatisticsEnabled(true) // Enable monitoring
        .build())
    .build();
```

### Monitoring

Enable logging for security monitoring:

```java
// Log all queries for audit trail
QueryBuilder<User> query = QueryBuilder.forEntity(User.class)
    .where("email", userInput);

QueryStats stats = query.getExecutionStats();
logger.info("Query executed: {}", stats.getSql());
```
